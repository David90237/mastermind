# mastermind

This is the public code that I copied from Andrew Tsegaye on his github for Mastermind. I'm just trying to change it a bit as I am learning python. I would like to change the result to somehow show for the 4 colors, a *, if the color is in the code but at the wrong place, a # if it's at the right place and a - if not in the code. something like : **#- . I would like to remove the need for spaces between the colors for the guess in this version too. Any help is welcome!
