# mastermind
Trying to code a simple Mastermind, guess a combination of 3 letters representing colors (ex: b = blue, y = yellow, r = rouge), among a list of 5 colors. 10 tries are allowed to find the combination, if a color is right and at the right place it should be shown as a star, if correct but at a wrong place, it should show as W otherwise wrong colors _
