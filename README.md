This is the public code from Andrew Tsegaye for the game, I'm just trying to try to change it a bit as I am learning python. I would like to chage the result to somehow show for the 4 colors, a !, if the color is in the code but at the wrong place, a # if it's at the right place and a - if not in the code. Any help is welcome!
